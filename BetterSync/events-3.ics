DESCRIPTION:LAYALI RAMADAN\nThe Sudan Benefit Fundraiser marks the 6th ann
 ual Layali Ramadan event organized by the Sudanese\nDiaspora Network (SDN
 ). Each year during Ramadan\, SDN selects a theme and beneficiaries that\
 naddress urgent issues in Sudan. Past initiatives have supported organiza
 tions working with children\,\nCOVID-19 responses\, and\, most recently\,
  the ongoing humanitarian crisis triggered by the war. This\nconflict has
  displaced 15 million Sudanese and left 24 million facing acute food inse
 curity\, with many\nmore at risk due to limited healthcare and educationa
 l access and increased susceptibility to diseases\nlike cholera.\nTraditi
 onally\, our fundraisers have been limited in scope. However\, given that
  30.4 million people in\nSudan now require humanitarian aid\, this year‚Äôs
  Sudan Benefit Fundraiser extended its activities\nbeyond Ramadan and con
 tinues to provide support a year later. The fundraiser aims to provide\nd
 isplaced Sudanese families with food\, critical services\, and medical eq
 uipment.\n\nHosted by: African Students Association at Arizona State Univ

DESCRIPTION:‚ÄúCreative‚Äù by the collective of Justin Maxon\, Marina Lopez\, 
 and Clara Takarabe\, the School of Art and Crisis (SOAC) is a socially en
 gaged art project that takes the form of an alternative institution desig
 ned to meet the complex needs of individuals navigating substance use dis
 order. By combining artistic and body-based practices with innovative ped
 agogical approaches\, SOAC creates a dynamic space where participants evo
 lve from learners into empowered teachers. This emergent structure allows
  different working methods to coexist\, evolve\, and interact in meaningf
 ul ways. Currently\, SOAC operates two distinct programs: Field Guide to 
 a Crisis and An Invitation to Rest.Justin Maxon (he/him) is an award-winn
 ing photographer\, educator\, and socially engaged artist. He has an MFA 
 in social practice and teaches in the Art Department at California State 
 Polytechnic University\, Humboldt. His practice is interdisciplinary and 
 collaborative\, utilizing photography alongside video\, performance\, nar
 rative\, and sculptural forms to create dialogical spaces that build incl
 usivity\, community participation\, and the value of person and place. He
  creates projects and alternative institutions that give people‚Äîoften exc
 luded from dominant spaces‚Äîopportunities to become resources for their co
 mmunities. He has received over $300\,000 in competitive grant/award fund
 ing for his work. Including receiving the American Aftermath Project Gran
 t\, the Aaron Siskind Foundation Fellowship\, and the Alexia Foundation P
 rofessional Grant. His work has been exhibited widely\, including at the 
 Museum of Chinese in America\; the Museum de Arte Acarigua-Araure in Vene
 zuela\, the OneArts Space in New York\, and the Bermuda National Gallery.

 ement of the organic process of casting itself. The material is manipulat
 ed to different textures in a way that highlights organic material and ma
 nual processes as non-stagnant\; each is unique and changeable for at lea
 st a period of time. This guest artist will be one to watch for our Engin
 eering and Material Science major student members as for him the material
 ity of cast metal becomes the artwork experience in itself.¬†\nAraan will

DESCRIPTION:Join us for a compelling lecture on¬†the historical and contemp
 orary uses of racial and ethnic imagery in sports and advertising in the 
 United States\, presented by¬†Dr. Myles Lynk\, a distinguished emeritus pr
 ofessor. This talk is based on research that began in 2008\, when the¬†NCA
 A banned the use of Native American imagery¬†by its member institutions an
 d has since evolved to explore the broader implications of racialized rep
 resentation in media\, branding\, and sports culture.\nDrawing from his e
 xperience as¬†ASU‚Äôs former NCAA Faculty Athletics Representative¬†and a¬†vis
 iting professor at Michigan State University\, our speaker will examine h
 ow these symbols have been used\, challenged\, and redefined. Through an 
 engaging¬†PowerPoint presentation\, attendees will gain insight into the l
 egal\, cultural\, and ethical dimensions of this issue and ongoing debate
 s surrounding representation in professional and collegiate sports.\nThis
  event is open to¬†students\, faculty\, and community members¬†interested i
 n¬†law\, media\, racial justice\, and sports policy. Don‚Äôt miss the opport
 unity to engage in a thought-provoking discussion on the intersection of¬†
 race\, identity\, and commercial influence¬†in American culture.\n¬†\n\nHos

 reaks down the complex interactions between psychoactive substances and t
 he brain.\nWith a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from UCLA and postdoctoral traini
 ng at Stanford and UCSF\, Dr. Olive‚Äôs research focuses on how drugs inter
 act with neurotransmitter systems\, alter synaptic plasticity\, and impac
 t cognition and behavior. His work is funded by the National Institute on
  Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoho
 lism (NIAAA)\, placing him at the forefront of addiction and psychopharma
 cology research.\nIn this lecture and interactive Q&A\, Dr. Olive will ex
 plore:üî¨ How psychedelics like LSD\, psilocybin\, and DMT affect neurotra
 nsmitter systemsüß† Their impact on neural circuits related to perception\
 , cognition\, and consciousnessüí° The role of neuroplasticity in potentia
 l therapeutic applications‚ö†Ô∏è Risks\, long-term effects\, and what current

  2025! Whether you're a seasoned b-boy/ b-girl or just discovering the cu
 lture\, this jam is for everyone!SDBC is ASU‚Äôs Sun Devil Breaking Club\,

  campus and in the local community. A free\, public\, outdoor\, family-fr
 iendly event on ASU‚Äôs Tempe campus\, our programming will include bringin
 g in esteemed Hip Hop community members\, tentatively Breakers who have b
 een sponsored by Red Bull\, to facilitate workshops that directly support
  the club\, its members and the greater Hip Hop community.This event is b
 ringing together the raw energy of the streets and the creativity of the 
 dance community for two exciting battles: a Community Battle and a Colleg
 iate Battle. We‚Äôll celebrate the roots of breakdancing\, where cyphers\, 
 music\, and art come together. Battles are key for breaking and it's an o
 pportunity to push yourself past your limits and to share and show off an
 y sick moves you've been working on. A cypher is often held before a batt
 le and it's encouraged that all breakers join. Our MC and DJs are legends
  in the Arizona dance scene\, their skills have been highlighted through 
 their participation in various hip hop events throughout the valley and i
 n some cases around the world. With years of experience and a deep connec
 tion to the culture\, Mcs and djs play a key role in breaking jams especi
 ally.This isn‚Äôt just a competition\, it‚Äôs a celebration of breaking\, com
 munity\, and the evolution of this dynamic art form. So come out\, suppor
 t your local dancers\, and witness the next generation of breakers rise t
 o the challenge. Let‚Äôs keep the culture alive and thriving!\n\nHosted by:

DESCRIPTION:Based on her recent book\,¬†Fraught Balance\, Professor¬†Shayna¬†
 Silverstein shows how Syrian dabke\, a popular dance music infused with c
 ollectivism and cultural memory\, has paradoxically contributed to isolat
 ion and fragmentation within Syrian society from the formation of the aut
 horitarian nation-state to the recent conflict. She also addresses questi
 ons raised by the transitional period following the collapse of the Assad
  regime\, including: what is the contribution of research in the wake of 
 sudden and intense political change? What does the study of popular dance
  music offer to a society as it rebuilds its educational and cultural ins
 titutions?\n\nHosted by: Dabke United\, South West Asian and North Africa

DESCRIPTION:Dear all\,¬†\nWe are excited to invite you to the guest artist 
 lecture of Louis-Charles Dionne\, where he will be presenting new and old
  works and discussing the history and cultural importance of the Nova Sco
 tia College of Art and Design. Dionne‚Äôs practice is anchored in sculpture
 \, installation\, and public art. His work is rooted in a vocabulary of l
 ow-interest objects that he repositions to challenge notions of function\
 , affordance\, and value. Dionne is interested in the non-heroic and anti
 -climactic experience.\nDionne starts visiting us on Monday\, 21st April\
 , during the foundry class between 4:30 and 7:15 pm and will be available
  for student questions and advice on recent and new works.¬†On Wednesday\,
  the 23rd of April (4:30 - 7:15 pm)\, Dionne will present his artist lect
 ure. Meetings will be held in sculpture room ART132 in the Art and Design
  building in Tempe.\nPlease visit Dionne's website here:https://www.louis

DESCRIPTION:Countdown to Denim Day with SRVP!¬†Denim Day is recognized on a
  Wednesday in April in honor of Sexual Assault Awareness Month. The campa
 ign began after a ruling by the Italian Supreme Court to overturn a rape 
 conviction because the justices felt that since the victim was wearing ti
 ght jeans\, she must have helped the person who raped her remove them\, t
 hereby implying consent. Following the reversal\, the women in the Italia
 n Parliament came to work wearing jeans in solidarity with the victim.\n\
